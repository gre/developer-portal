Live Apps are displayed in the discover section of Ledger Live on desktop (Windows, Mac, Linux) and mobile (Android only, iOS is not currently included).

We call it a Live App, as it is usable directly in Ledger Live, but initially it is either a DApp or a Non-DApp.
   
## What are DApps and non-DApps?

- **DApps** are decentralized application. That means they are applications that work on a blockchain network. 
- **Non-DApps** are just your regular web applications that work on a centralized server, as any Web 2.0 application does.

Depending on whether you have a **DApp** or a **non-DApp** to insert into Ledger Live, this diagram summarizes what you need to do.
