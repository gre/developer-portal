## 1- Discord

To get the extension, join our Discord server using [this link](https://developers.ledger.com/discord-pro) and head over to the Ledger Connect channel

## 2- Coding

### APIs

Connect injects a web3 provider (EIP-1193) similar to other extensions and supports the same APIs. [add details]

1. Check if `ethereum.isLedgerConnect` is true to determine if the user has the extension installed

2. Use common Ethereum APIs. We currently support the following:
	- net_version
	- th_chainId
	- eth_accounts
	- eth_requestAccounts
	- eth_sign (only with a utf8 Buffer)
	- personal_sign
	- eth_signTypedData_v3
	- eth_signTypedData_v4
	- eth_sendTransaction

### Supported wallet libraries

You can use this [web3-react-ledgerconnect-connector](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ledgerhq/web3-react-ledgerconnect-connector) together with the web3-react wallet library or [web3-onboard-ledgerconnect](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ledgerhq/web3-onboard-ledgerconnect) with web3-onboard in your project.

{% include alert.html style="tip" text="Eventually, you will be able to integrate Ledger Connect to your DApp either with our APIs and a SDK or with wallet librairies. You will be informed on Discord when this will be available." %}

## 3- Ledger logo

[In this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KWQwTQJTnBMESyrpt17Cn0hT1HmQ_8BH?usp=sharing) your will find Ledger's logo to display in your application. 


## 4- Web3Checks (recommended)

You can be added to the Web3Checks whitelist to avoid users receiving a warning. Please send us your DApp domain name, DApp name and token name if any, using the form below.

## 5- Communication

When you have finished the development of your DApp, please go over to Discord and contact us. We will then agree with you on how and when to make announcements on social networks.
