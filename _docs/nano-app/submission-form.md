## Ready to submit your App for review?

Once you have finished your work and you have collected all the App items (use the [Submission form Content](../deliverables-checklist) as a checklist), you must enter them in the [form](https://ledger.typeform.com/to/Nano-App).

Make sure you thoroughly complete the form to ensure a speedy release process.

{% include alert.html style="important" text="The integration process will only start if you answer accurately to all the questions." %}

This is the end of your process.  
From here on, all communications will take place on Discord.  
Thank you.  

Looking forward to seeing your App in the Ledger Live Manager!
