[Ledger App Builder](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-app-builder) is a container image which holds the all dependencies to compile an application for Nano hardware wallets.

You need to clone it with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-app-builder 
```

<!--  -->
{% include alert.html style="important" text="If you chose to build your app differently, please make sure you can still compile it with Ledger App Builder, as it will be required for deployment." %}
<!--  -->

To use the container image, you need to either install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/), [Podman](https://podman.io/), or [Buildah](https://buildah.io/) and do the following steps.

## 1. Build the container (standard way)...

The container can be build using standard tools, run one of the following commands:

```bash
# If you're using Docker
sudo docker build -t ledger-app-builder:latest .
# If you're using Podman (from https://podman.io/)
podman build -t ledger-app-builder:latest .
# If you're using Buildah (from https://buildah.io/)
buildah bud -t ledger-app-builder:latest .
```

## ... Or Build with App Scanner

Images can embed the [Coverity Scan](https://scan.coverity.com/) build tool. It is an excellent static analysis tool, and it can be very useful to find bugs in Nano apps.

The build tool must be downloaded before building the image. The archive can be downloaded from <https://scan.coverity.com/download>. Download is available to everyone, but it requires to create an account. After having registered, download Coverity Build Tool 2020.09 for Linux64 and place the downloaded archive in the `coverity` directory.

Then, build the container with one of the following commands:

```bash
# If you're using Docker
sudo docker build -t ledger-app-scanner:latest .
# If you're using Podman (from https://podman.io/)
podman build -t ledger-app-scanner:latest .
# If you're using Buildah (from https://buildah.io/)
buildah bud -t ledger-app-scanner:latest .
```

## 2. Compile your app in the container

### 2.1 Get the Ledger Boilerplate Application

The Boilerplate Application was specifically designed for developers to play around with and read the code. You can clone it in your working folder to start a new project.
Applications that support multiple BOLOS devices are typically contained within a single repository, so you can use the same repository to build an app for different Ledger devices.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-boilerplate.git
```

### 2.2 Build the Application

#### For the Nano S

In the source folder of the application (replace 'realpath' with your app's local path):

```bash
$ # docker can be replaced with podman or buildah without sudo
$ sudo docker run --rm -ti -v "$(realpath .):/app" ledger-app-builder:latest
root@656be163fe84:/app# make
```


#### For the Nano X and Nano S Plus

For Nano X and S Plus, specify the `BOLOS_SDK` environment variable before building your app, in the source folder of the app:

For Nano X (replace 'realpath' with your app's local path):

```bash
$ # docker can be replaced with podman or buildah without sudo
$ sudo docker run --rm -ti -v "$(realpath .):/app" ledger-app-builder:latest
root@656be163fe84:/app# BOLOS_SDK=$NANOX_SDK make
```

For Nano S Plus (replace 'realpath' with your app's local path):

```bash
$ # docker can be replaced with podman or buildah without sudo
$ sudo docker run --rm -ti -v "$(realpath .):/app" ledger-app-builder:latest
root@656be163fe84:/app# BOLOS_SDK=$NANOSP_SDK make
```


<!--  -->
{% include alert.html style="note" text="If you change the <code>BOLOS_SDK</code> variable between two builds, you can first use <code>make clean</code> to avoid errors." %}
<!--  -->


#### Using the Clang Static Analyzer

The Docker image includes the [Clang Static Analyzer](https://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/), which can be invoked with (replace 'realpath' with your app's local path):

```bash
$ # docker can be replaced with podman or buildah without sudo
$ sudo docker run --rm -ti -v "$(realpath .):/app" ledger-app-builder:latest
root@656be163fe84:/app# make scan-build
```

### 2.3 Exit the image

The build generates several files in your application folder and especially the `app.elf` that can be loaded to a [Nano S or S Plus](../load) or into the [Nano X or S Emulator (Speculos)](../../speculos/installation/build).

You can exit the image, with the `exit` command.
