## Introduction
In this section, you will see how to create a React Native application using the [@ledgerhq/react-native-hid](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/tree/develop/libs/ledgerjs/packages/react-native-hid) (Only on Android).
For this project some general prerequisites are mandatory and you can find them [here](../prerequisites).

Then you can now go through the prerequisite for Android development below.

## Prerequisites

#### Android Studio Installation
Download and install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio), choose the version of your operating system.

When Android Studio is installed, open it.

*Fig. 1: Android Studio Window*

Go to Settings => Appearance & Behavior => System Settings => Android SDK and check the "Show Package Details" checkbox on the bottom right of the windows.

*Fig. 3: Android Studio SDK Settings*

#### Install Homebrew
Homebrew is a package manager for macOS. When it needs to install software from third-party websites. To install it, run:

```console
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/uninstall)"
```

#### Install watchman
React Native uses watchman to detect real-time code changes and it automatically builds and pushes the update to your device without manually refreshing.

```console
brew install watchman
```


#### Install Java JRE and JDK
 There is a risk of react-native build failure if you don’t have a complete installation of Java. Downloading Android Studio is not enough since it comes bundled with its own JRE.

```console
brew install --cask adoptopenjdk/openjdk/adoptopenjdk8
```


#### Install React Native
With React Native, you can write an application in Javascript and then the React Native Compiler will convert your Javascript code into native code for iOS and Android environments.
React Native command line interface can be installed using npm as below.

```console
npm install -g react-native-cli
```


#### Set the environnement variables
If you are using bash, put the environment variable into the bash_profile as below:

```console
cd ~/
touch ~/.bash_profile;
open -e .bash_profile
```

```console
export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
```

Do the same if you are using zsh or anything else. Remember the file will be named differently (eg. zsh => .zprofile)


## Android App Build
Now that we have set up the prerequisites, you can now create the application.
In this integration, we will use the ethereum application.

### Project Initialization
First, open a terminal and create a new project. For this tutorial the project will be named “myApp”.

Run:

```console
react-native init myApp
cd myApp
```

<!--  -->
{% include alert.html style="tip" text="During the initialization, required 'CocoaPods' dependencies are installed and it may take time." %}
<!--  -->

### Code Implementation

Run:

```console
touch App.js
touch polyfill.js
```
Open your folder in a code editor, it must look like this.

*Fig. 4: Folder of the Application*


#### polyfill.js

In polyfill.js copy-paste the following code:

```javascript
global.Buffer = require("buffer").Buffer;
```

#### index.js

Then import the "polyfill.js" in "index.js" as shown below:

```javascript
/**
 * @format
 */

import "./polyfill";    //import this
import {AppRegistry} from 'react-native';
import App from './App';
import {name as appName} from './app.json';

AppRegistry.registerComponent(appName, () => App);
```

#### App.js

In App.js copy-paste the following code:

```javascript
import React, { Component } from "react";
import { StyleSheet, Text, View } from "react-native";
import { listen } from "@ledgerhq/logs";

import TransportHID from "@ledgerhq/react-native-hid";
import AppEth from "@ledgerhq/hw-app-eth";


// This is helpful if you want to see BLE logs. (only to use in dev mode)

class App extends Component {
  state = {
    transport: null
  };


  onSelectDevice = async () => {
    try {
      const transport = await TransportHID.create();
      listen(log => console.log(log));
      const eth = new AppEth(transport);
      const path = "44'/60'/0'/0/0"; // HD derivation path
      const { address } = await eth.getAddress(path, false);
      this.setState({ transport: address });
      await eth.getAddress(path, true);
    } catch (e) {
      throw new Error(e);
      return null;
    }
  };

  render() {
    const { transport } = this.state;
     if(!transport){
       return (
        <View style={styles.header}>
          <Text style={styles.headerTitle}>Scanning for Ledger...</Text>
          <Text style={styles.headerSubtitle} onPress={() => {this.onSelectDevice()}}>
            Power up your Ledger and enter your pin. Then tap the screen
          </Text>
        </View>
      );
    }else{
      return (<View style={styles.header}>
        <Text style={styles.title}>Ledger Live Ethereum Account 1</Text>
        <Text style={styles.headerTitle}>
          {transport}
        </Text>
      </View>
      );
    }
  };
}

export default App;



const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  header: {
    paddingTop: 80,
    paddingBottom: 36,
    alignItems: "center"
  },
  headerTitle: {
    fontSize: 22,
    marginBottom: 16
  },
  headerSubtitle: {
    fontSize: 12,
    color: "#999"
  },
  list: {
    flex: 1
  },
  errorTitle: {
    color: "#c00",
    fontSize: 16,
    marginBottom: 16
  }
});

```
### Dependencies Installation

Run:

```console
npm install --save buffer
npm install --save @ledgerhq/logs
npm install --save @ledgerhq/hw-app-eth
npm install --save @ledgerhq/hw-transport-webusb
```

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th colspan="1">Package</th>
            <th colspan="2">What does it do?</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/buffer">Buffer</a></td>
            <td colspan="2"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ledgerhq/logs">@ledgerhq/logs</a></td>
            <td colspan="2">It helps you ask your Ledger device to access the ethereum address.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><a href="https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/tree/develop/libs/ledgerjs/packages/hw-app-eth">@ledgerhq/hw-app-eth</a></td>
            <td colspan="2">It helps you ask your Ledger device to access the ethereum address.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><a href="https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/tree/develop/libs/ledgerjs/packages/react-native-hid">@ledgerhq/react-native-hid</a></td>
            <td colspan="2">It provides you with all the methods to interact with  your Ledger with an HID connexion.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

#### Package.json dependencies

Now that the dependencies are installed you can find them in the “package.js”.
This is how your “package.json” must look like.

```javascript
{
  "name": "myApp",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "android": "react-native run-android",
    "ios": "react-native run-ios",
    "start": "react-native start",
    "test": "jest",
    "lint": "eslint ."
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@ledgerhq/hw-app-eth": "^6.15.2",
    "@ledgerhq/logs": "^6.10.0",
    "@ledgerhq/react-native-hid": "^6.11.2",
    "buffer": "^6.0.3",
    "react": "17.0.2",
    "react-native": "0.66.3"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@babel/core": "^7.16.0",
    "@babel/runtime": "^7.16.3",
    "@react-native-community/eslint-config": "^3.0.1",
    "babel-jest": "^27.3.1",
    "eslint": "^8.3.0",
    "jest": "^27.3.1",
    "metro-react-native-babel-preset": "^0.66.2",
    "react-test-renderer": "17.0.2"
  },
  "jest": {
    "preset": "react-native"
  }
}
```
#### Build.gradle Modification
In “build.gradle”, in the "android" folder change `minSdkVersion = 21` to `minSdkVersion = 24`.

You can now test the application you have built.

## Android App Test

The app testing will be executed on your smartphone because the android studio environment does not allow you to use either Bluetooth or USB connexion.

<!--  -->
{% include alert.html style="tip" text="Please refer to the information for <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22604305/how-to-use-android-emulator-for-testing-bluetooth-application' class='alert-link'> Android Emulator Limitation </a>." %}
<!--  -->

### Enable Developer Settings
To integrate an application on your android smartphone you have to enable the developer role.
To do that go to  Settings > About Phone > Build Number, and tap 7 times on build number to enable the developer settings.

Then go to Settings > System > Advanced > Developer Options and enable the  "USB debugging" as well as "Install via USB"

Connect your phone to your computer, and run the below command to see if your device is connected:
```console
adb devices
```
If all goes well, the list of devices is displayed as shown below:

<!--  -->

### Start the Development Server
You can now open a terminal, navigate to your "myApp" folder, and start the server by running:
```console
npm start
```

### Install the App on Device
Keep the terminal where "metro" is running open and open a new terminal.
In this new terminal go to your app folder:
```console
cd myApp
```

Run the command below to install the application on your android device. It's assumed that your device is recognized by the command `adb devices` as the [Previous Step](#enable-developer-settings) mentioned. 
```console
npm run android
```

A window will pop up on your android device to install the application. Click on "Yes" to install it and run it.

When launching the application it will be displayed like the image below.
