## Contact us

You can reach out to us [on Discord](https://developers.ledger.com/discord-pro). Please introduce yourself and your project to the developer community in the #introductions channel. You will be provided with information about how to send your application.


## Wait for the Ledger review

After sending your application, it will not be listed in Ledger Live right away. Ledger needs to perform some tests.

An application will be listed publicly (official Ledger support) only when:
- It has been tested and validated by at least someone from Ledger Developer Success Team,
- Ledger is ready to communicate officially about the app release (tweet, blogpost, website page update),
- Customer support pages are available on Ledger Help Center,
- General T&Cs have been signed,
- There is a link for a tutorial hosted on third party website,
- Contact information (Name, Surname, Legal Entity, URL, email address, phone number) have been provided in the application form,
- A video of your application running in the Ledger Discover section has been provided in the application form.

Once Ledger finishes the review, your application is added to the Ledger Live “Discover” section, and all our users are able to use it.
